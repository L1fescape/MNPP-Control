# MNPP
======

Once upon a time, there was a pretty sweet bundle of programs for OS X called MNPP (http://getmnpp.org/). MNPP, standing for Mac + Nginx + Percona + PHP, had everything a web developer could ask for: a fancy web server, a pretty sweet open source fork of MySQL, and a scripting language to tie the two together.  

There was just one problem though.

The control panel for starting and stopping this bundle's stellar services was just a menu bar item. Ugh! Time to change that.


# MNPP Control
==============

MNPP Control is a little application to control the state of each component in MNPP. It's my first cocoa application, and definitely has room for improvement. I'll be updating this as I learn more about developing for OS X.
